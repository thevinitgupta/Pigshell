## Why Pigshell?
Being in my 3rd year of CS Engineering, I have been introduced to image processing. It is really an interesting domain to work in.

So to get familiar with it, and what better way that building something in hackathon, I have decided to build a Web App.
It is a really simple one : `a pixel to ASCII filter`.

## Features 
 
1. Uploading an image and converting it into ASCII image.
2. Saving it in the users account.
3. Retrieving them from any where.
